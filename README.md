![Hello All!](./images/This_is_me.jpg)
# Welcome to Keri Hedman's TWP 2.0 Project #

I am an experienced programmer whose varied experience in
customer service positions gives me a unique perspective
on working with customers and their needs.  This includes how
to gather the necessary information for project design
while keeping business requirements in mind.

This website design project is under the direction of the
Tech Workforce Program (TWP) in Chattanooga, TN.  The TWP in
designed to teach modern website design and basic programming
concepts to people that range from no formal or informal experience in programming of any kind to those with bachelor degrees, like me.

I became sick over 10 years ago and fell out of the current
flow of time in the world of computers and programming.  As we know, programming concepts and languages change rapidly.  If you cannot keep up, you become left behind.  For me, this program is a way to return to the world of computers and programming, and to learn about the new world of website design.
