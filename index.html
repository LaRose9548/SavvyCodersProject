        <p>I am an experienced programmer whose varied experience in
    customer service positions gives me a unique perspective
    on working with customers and their needs.  This includes how
    to gather the necessary information for project design
    while keeping business requirements in mind.</p>
        <p>This website design project is under the direction of the
    Tech Workforce Program (TWP) in Chattanooga, TN.  The TWP in
    designed to teach modern website design and basic programming
    concepts to people that range from no formal or informal experience
    in programming of any kind to those with bachelor degrees, like me.</p>
        <p>I became sick over 10 years ago and fell out of the current
    flow of time in the world of computers and programming.  As we know,
    programming concepts and languages change rapidly.  If you cannot
    keep up, you become left behind.  For me, this program is a way to
    return to the world of computers and programming, and to learn about
    the new world of website design.</p>
